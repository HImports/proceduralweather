This was originally compiled using gcc on ubuntu. To compile it with a similar setup, just issue the command >make all. If you're not sure, look at the makefile and make sure the header files are included correctly for your OS. Also you need gcc.
Then just use the executable and you should be able to generate the maps yourself. You can change the seed in worldgen.h to get a different result.
Enjoy!
